I miss her so damn much.  I keep getting these flashbacks of us doing things together; laughing, kissing, in love.  It really hurts man.  She is the Love of my life.  I just loved everything about her.  I just dont get it.  Why do I love her so much.  What is it about her?  Her demeanor?  Her looks?  Her smell?  Everything.  She was physically and sometimes emotionally perfect for me.  And Oh my god do I Love her, and cherish her.  I just cant seem to show it.  I took her for so much granted.  I treated her like shit.  She really pissed me off though.  A lot.  We had HORRIBLE fights.  I was a monster, and I was wrong.
